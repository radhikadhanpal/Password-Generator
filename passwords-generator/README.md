# Password Generator

I have created a web app using React.js called "Password Generator." This app is designed to generate strong passwords by randomly combining uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

The purpose of this software is to provide users with a tool to generate strong passwords easily. In today's digital age, having strong passwords is crucial for protecting personal and sensitive information.

The Password Generator aims to simplify the process of creating strong passwords by automatically generating random sequences of characters, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. By using a combination of these different types of characters, the generated passwords are more secure and harder to guess or crack.

# Web Pages

The web app consists of one main page where users can input their preferences for generating a password. After clicking the "Generate Password" button, a strong password is dynamically created based on their selections. The generated password is then displayed on the screen. Users have the option to interact further by adjusting the form inputs and generating new passwords as needed.
